# 8 Bit Computer Schematics

Stripboard schematics for building an 8-bit computer

These files will open with [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/).

Except Fritzing is no longer available without payment / building it yourself.
More recent files will open with DIYLC - the DIY Layout Creator.
For designs that were made with Fritzing, I've included screenshots of each board with and without components on it.

See [my blog](http://writing.hcarver.com) for context.
